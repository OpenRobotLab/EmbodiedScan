In the realm of computer vision and robotics, embodied agents are expected to explore their environment and carry out human instructions.
This necessitates the ability to fully understand 3D scenes given their first-person observations and contextualize them into language for interaction.
However, traditional research focuses more on scene-level input and output setups from a global view.
To address the gap, we introduce <b>EmbodiedScan, a multi-modal, ego-centric 3D perception dataset and benchmark for holistic 3D scene understanding.</b>
It encompasses over <b>5k scans encapsulating 1M ego-centric RGB-D views, 1M language prompts, 160k 3D-oriented boxes spanning over 760 categories, some of which partially align with LVIS, and dense semantic occupancy with 80 common categories.</b>
Building upon this database, we introduce a baseline framework named <b>Embodied Perceptron</b>. It is capable of processing an arbitrary number of multi-modal inputs and demonstrates remarkable 3D perception capabilities, both within the two series of benchmarks we set up, i.e., fundamental 3D perception tasks and language-grounded tasks, and <b>in the wild</b>.

## üî• News

- \[2023-12\] We release the [paper](./assets/EmbodiedScan.pdf) of EmbodiedScan. Please check the [webpage](https://tai-wang.github.io/embodiedscan) and view our demos!

## üìö Getting Started

### Installation

We test our codes under the following environment:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- NVIDIA Driver: 525.147.05
- CUDA 12.0
- Python 3.8.18
- PyTorch 1.11.0+cu113
- PyTorch3D 0.7.2

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/EmbodiedScan.git
cd EmbodiedScan
```

2. Create an environment and install PyTorch.

```bash
conda create -n embodiedscan python=3.8 -y  # pytorch3d needs python>3.7
conda activate embodiedscan
# Install PyTorch, for example, install PyTorch 1.11.0 for CUDA 11.3
# For more information, please refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

3. Install EmbodiedScan.

```bash
# We plan to make EmbodiedScan easier to install by "pip install EmbodiedScan".
# Please stay tuned for the future official release.
# Make sure you are under ./EmbodiedScan/
# This script will install the dependencies and EmbodiedScan package automatically.
python install.py all
# This command installs all of embodiedscan's dependencies,
# including the execution and visualization modules.
# If you only want to use part of the functionality,
# you can run 'python install.py run/visual' as an alternative.
```

### Data Preparation

Please refer to the [guide](data/README.md) for downloading and organization.

We will update the authorization approach and release remaining data afterward. Please stay tuned.

### Tutorial

We provide a simple tutorial [here](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/EmbodiedScan/blob/main/embodiedscan/tutorial.ipynb) as a guideline for the basic analysis and visualization of our dataset. Welcome to try and post your suggestions!

## üì¶ Model and Benchmark

We will release the code for model training and benchmark with pretrained checkpoints in the 2024 Q1.

### Model Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/framework.png" align="center" width="100%">
</p>
Embodied Perceptron accepts RGB-D sequence with any number of views along with texts as multi-modal input. It uses classical encoders to extract features for each modality and adopts dense and isomorphic sparse fusion with corresponding decoders for different predictions. The 3D features integrated with the text feature can be further used for language-grounded understanding.

### Benchmark

Please see the [paper](./assets/EmbodiedScan.pdf) for details of our two benchmarks, fundamental 3D perception and language-grounded benchmarks. This dataset is still scaling up and the benchmark is being polished and extended. Please stay tuned for our recent updates.
