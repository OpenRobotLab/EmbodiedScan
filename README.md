In the realm of computer vision and robotics, embodied agents are expected to explore their environment and carry out human instructions.
This necessitates the ability to fully understand 3D scenes given their first-person observations and contextualize them into language for interaction.
However, traditional research focuses more on scene-level input and output setups from a global view.
To address the gap, we introduce <b>EmbodiedScan, a multi-modal, ego-centric 3D perception dataset and benchmark for holistic 3D scene understanding.</b>
It encompasses over <b>5k scans encapsulating 1M ego-centric RGB-D views, 1M language prompts, 160k 3D-oriented boxes spanning over 760 categories, some of which partially align with LVIS, and dense semantic occupancy with 80 common categories.</b>
Building upon this database, we introduce a baseline framework named <b>Embodied Perceptron</b>. It is capable of processing an arbitrary number of multi-modal inputs and demonstrates remarkable 3D perception capabilities, both within the two series of benchmarks we set up, i.e., fundamental 3D perception tasks and language-grounded tasks, and <b>in the wild</b>.

## üî• News

- \[2024-03\] We first release the data and baselines for the challenge. Please fill in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUXEDTksGiqHZp31j7Zp7zlCNV7p_08uViwP_Nbzfn3g6hhw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to apply for downloading the data and try our baselines. Welcome any feedback!
- \[2024-02\] We will co-organize [Autonomous Grand Challenge](https://opendrivelab.com/challenge2024/) in CVPR 2024. Welcome to try the Multi-View 3D Visual Grounding track! We will release more details about the challenge with the baseline after the Chinese New Year.
- \[2023-12\] We release the [paper](./assets/EmbodiedScan.pdf) of EmbodiedScan. Please check the [webpage](https://tai-wang.github.io/embodiedscan) and view our demos!

## üìö Getting Started

### Installation

We test our codes under the following environment:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- NVIDIA Driver: 525.147.05
- CUDA 12.0
- Python 3.8.18
- PyTorch 1.11.0+cu113
- PyTorch3D 0.7.2

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/EmbodiedScan.git
cd EmbodiedScan
```

2. Create an environment and install PyTorch.

```bash
conda create -n embodiedscan python=3.8 -y  # pytorch3d needs python>3.7
conda activate embodiedscan
# Install PyTorch, for example, install PyTorch 1.11.0 for CUDA 11.3
# For more information, please refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

3. Install EmbodiedScan.

```bash
# We plan to make EmbodiedScan easier to install by "pip install EmbodiedScan".
# Please stay tuned for the future official release.
# Make sure you are under ./EmbodiedScan/
# This script will install the dependencies and EmbodiedScan package automatically.
# use [python install.py run] to install only the execution dependencies
# use [python install.py visual] to install only the visualization dependencies
python install.py all  # install all the dependencies
```

**Note:** The automatic installation script make each step a subprocess and the related messages are only printed when the subprocess is finished or killed. Therefore, it is normal to seemingly hang when installing heavier packages, such as Mink Engine and PyTorch3D.

BTW, from our experience, it is easier to encounter problems when installing these two packages. Feel free to post your questions or suggestions during the installation procedure.

### Data Preparation

Please refer to the [guide](data/README.md) for downloading and organization.

We will update the authorization approach and release remaining data afterward. Please stay tuned.

### Tutorial

We provide a simple tutorial [here](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/EmbodiedScan/blob/main/embodiedscan/tutorial.ipynb) as a guideline for the basic analysis and visualization of our dataset. Welcome to try and post your suggestions!

### Demo Inference

We provide a demo for running EmbodiedScan's model on a sample scan. Please download the raw dara from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nXIbH56TmIoEVv1AML7mZS0szTR5HgNC/view?usp=sharing) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1GK9Z4M-VbRSMWErB39QGpg?pwd=v5w1) and refer to the [notebook](demo/demo.ipynb) for more details.

## üì¶ Model and Benchmark

### Model Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/framework.png" align="center" width="100%">
</p>
Embodied Perceptron accepts RGB-D sequence with any number of views along with texts as multi-modal input. It uses classical encoders to extract features for each modality and adopts dense and isomorphic sparse fusion with corresponding decoders for different predictions. The 3D features integrated with the text feature can be further used for language-grounded understanding.

### Training and Inference

We provide configs for different tasks [here](configs/) and you can run the train and test script in the [tools folder](tools/) for training and inference.
For example, to train a multi-view 3D detection model with pytorch, just run:

```bash
python tools/train.py configs/detection/mv-det3d_8xb4_embodiedscan-3d-284class-9dof.py --work-dir=work_dirs/mv-3ddet --launcher="pytorch"
```

Or on the cluster with multiple machines, run the script with the slurm launcher following the sample script provided [here](tools/mv-grounding.sh).

NOTE: To run the multi-view 3D grounding experiments, please first download the 3D detection pretrained model to accelerate its training procedure. After downloading the detection checkpoint, please check the path used in the config, for example, the `load_from` [here](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/EmbodiedScan/blob/main/configs/grounding/mv-grounding_8xb12_embodiedscan-vg-9dof.py#L210), is correct.

To inference and evaluate the model (e.g., the checkpoint `work_dirs/mv-3ddet/epoch_12.pth`), just run the test script:

```bash
python tools/test.py configs/detection/mv-det3d_8xb4_embodiedscan-3d-284class-9dof.py work_dirs/mv-3ddet/epoch_12.pth --launcher="pytorch"
```

### Benchmark

We preliminarily provide several baseline results here with their logs and pretrained models.

Note that the performance is a little different from the results provided in the paper because we re-split the training set as the released training and validation set while keeping the original validation set as the test set for the public benchmark.
